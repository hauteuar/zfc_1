            <p>
              When deciding whether to do it yourself, evaluate the importance of your immigration matter. No matter how inexpensive, without positive results, the outcome will be costly.
              Your professional and family considerations should govern the decision â€“ immigration can determine the choice of profession and degree of success in oneâ€™s professional life.
              Please do not forget that immigration also impacts the future of your immediate family and descendants for generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new immigration program incorporates many technical issues. The process is becoming harder and more and more competitive.
              It is critical that the application process is well supported with the proper documents and that you are represented professionally.
              If your case is refused you cannot fight back, you cannot argue or challenge an Immigration officer. You are not aware of the Acts; Regulations; Appeals; Procedures.
